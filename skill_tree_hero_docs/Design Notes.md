# General Concept
- The player will make their way down a skill tree and the objective is to unlock all skills in the tree in the fastest time possible
- Nodes can be single-clicked which should pop-up a card to display more info about the node
- Skills unlock by clicking and holding. Progress slowly decays if you do not hold. Nodes will give more skill points and/or unlock abilities that can help unlock skills quicker
- 2-4 abilities can be acquired that need to be activated and have cooldowns
- Player will have some stats to start (amp, freq, and critical chance )
- Would be fun if skill tree was randomize for each run as well
- Click and drag camera with bounding or shrinking nodes, not sure yet

# Learning Goals
- Using this game to learn how to program and design a skill tree and make unlocking things "fun" through animation and sound
- Implement nesting custom resources in some form or fashion
- Also start learning what I need to keep track of for RPG type stats and how to design around it

# Visual Look
- Dark background with pale but "bright" neon colours (lightsaber colours). Maybe a chance to introduce some shaders for particle effects for flair
- Nodes will just be a circle with click progress as an outline travelling around circle
- [Color pallet example](https://colorhunt.co/palette/27005d9400ffaed2ffe4f1ff) [Color pallet 2](https://colorhunt.co/palette/343a407952b3ffc107e1e8eb)
- Icons for abilities will be downloaded from [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/)

# Constraints and Limitations
- 4 weeks from code start and walk away
- portrait resolution (for mobile) 1080x1920
- Controls only using mouse clicking and onscreen buttons
